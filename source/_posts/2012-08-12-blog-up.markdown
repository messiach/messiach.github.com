This is the first post I'm making on this blog (obviously). 
The intent is to share some of my experiences coding, both in the PLM realm and just in general.
Perhaps this blog will also improve my writing again - funny to think I <i>used</i> to write quite often, but have gotten so rusty at it...

I jump around quite often between languages and paradigms - learning much and having a lot of fun :)
By trade, I'm a Java developer of sorts...and a systems and migration person of sorts.
But, I've developed in many languages and on many different systems.

Currently, my focus has been on developing a front end in Clojure for one of the migration tools I'm using. 
I'm also going through the Standford lectures on Programming Paradigms to refresh myself on the low level concepts I've been away from for oh so long...
